# <p> Hi,<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px" /> I'm <a href="https://github.com/A-R-S-D/">Alireza</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80" src="https://github.com/A-R-S-D/A-R-S-D/blob/49d66e2721eef583be6cde61ff187c15a3be4ea4/resources/gifs/helloGreetingsMicroBits.gif"> </p>
- As a passionate embedded systems engineer and modern C++ programmer, I have honed my skills in STM32, ESP32, and AVR MCUs, and their respective platforms including STM32Cube, Arduino, and Codevision and developed an open source user friendly lib <a href="https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy/WAVRecorder">WAVRecorder</a> to record audio. I'm also highly interested in computer networks and database concepts and contributed to courses Embedded systems and Assembly (as head TA), Computer Networking and Principles of Database Design in <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en/">AUT</a> during my BSE.

- My MS.C. is concentrated in AI fields. So I'm keenly looking forward to opportunities to deepen my knowledge and fulfill my enthusiasm in the field. Especially if it's associated with the IoT workspace(which is my enduring love).
