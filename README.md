🎓 **MSc Student in Artificial Intelligence | University of Tehran**  
🔍 **Research Focus**: Vision-Language Models, Anomaly Detection, Efficient Fine-Tuning 

I'm currently completing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran, where my thesis is centered on **data- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of vision-language foundation models** for **zero-shot image anomaly detection**, which resulted in the paper [**Crane**](https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy/Crane). With a growing interest, I explore techniques for deploying **deep learning** capabilities in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

🛠️ **Embedded Systems Engineer | Modern C++ Enthusiast** &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/A-R-S-D/A-R-S-D/raw/49d66e2721eef583be6cde61ff187c15a3be4ea4/resources/gifs/helloGreetingsMicroBits.gif" width="40">

Before diving into AI, I spent several years during my BSc at Amirkabir University of Technology working with embedded systems and low-level development. I developed [**WAVRecorder**](https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy/WAVRecorder), a user-friendly open-source library for audio recording. 

<!-- 🔭 I’m particularly drawn to research opportunities that let me deepen my understanding of **intelligent perception systems**, especially when applied in the context of **IoT** — a long-standing passion of mine.  -->

💬 Always happy to connect, collaborate, and learn — especially on projects that bridge embedded intelligence with scalable AI.
