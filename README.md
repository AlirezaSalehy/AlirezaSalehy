# <p> Hi<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px" />, I'm <a href="https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy">Alireza</a> </p>

🎓 **MSc Student in Artificial Intelligence | University of Tehran**  
🔍 **Research Focus**: Vision-Language Models, Anomaly Detection, Efficient Fine-Tuning 

I'm currently completing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran, where my research centers on **data- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of vision-language foundation models** for **zero-shot image anomaly detection**. My work explores the intersection of **deep learning**, **prompt learning**, and **multimodal systems**, with a growing interest in deploying these capabilities in real-world, resource-constrained environments.  

🔭 I’m particularly drawn to research opportunities that let me deepen my understanding of **intelligent perception systems**, especially when applied in the context of **IoT** — a long-standing passion of mine.

🛠️ **Embedded Systems Engineer | Modern C++ Enthusiast** &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/A-R-S-D/A-R-S-D/raw/49d66e2721eef583be6cde61ff187c15a3be4ea4/resources/gifs/helloGreetingsMicroBits.gif" width="40">

Before diving into AI, I spent several years during my BSc at Amirkabir University of Technology working with embedded systems and low-level development. I developed [**WAVRecorder**](https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy/WAVRecorder), a user-friendly open-source library for audio recording.
