- Currently studying for MSc in AI at <a href="https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en">UT</a> with focus on Anomaly Detection leveraging Knowledge Distillation and maybe Vision-Language Models. I welcome opportunities that deepen my knowledge and fulfill enthusiasm in the field, especially if it's associated with the IoT workspace (which is my enduring passion).

- As a passionate embedded systems engineer and modern C++ programmer, I have honed my skills in STM32, ESP32, and AVR MCUs, and their respective platforms including STM32Cube, Arduino, and Codevision and developed an open source user friendly lib <a href="https://github.com/AlirezaSalehy/WAVRecorder">WAVRecorder</a>. I'm also highly interested in computer networks and database concepts and contributed to courses Embedded systems and Assembly (as head TA), Computer Networking and Principles of Database Design at <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en/">AUT</a> during my BSE designing HWs and Embedded systems' lab materials.
